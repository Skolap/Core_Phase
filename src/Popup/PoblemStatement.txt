Add an event handler to the columns such that when you click on any column it should alert the user with the text inside the column, using the ‘alert’ function.


Add 300*300 pixels width and height, any background color, and necessary padding/margin for the gap between columns using external CSS.
Make the document responsive such that when:
the screen width is less than 720px, only 1 column in a row is displayed,
the screen width is greater than 720px and less than 1000px, only 2 columns in a row are displayed,
the screen width is greater than 1000px, 3 columns in a row are displayed.
Add any animation of your choice using CSS.
