Construct an object which contains a schoolâ€™s details like cohort name, learners, and address, using a constructor function or a class.
Example of object:
{
   name: "name of the school",
   learners: ["Learner 1", "Learner 2", "Learner 3"],
   address: "Mumbai"

Create a method inside the constructor function or class which prints the name of the school.
